For in the morning of our love, there came<br />
The spirit singing such entrancing notes,<br />
As sweeps the whole empyrian with a flame,<br />
Wherein, a dream, pure lofty pleasure floats,<br />
And love and beauty find their mellow throats,<br />
In glorious fervor, drinking from the golden bowl,<br />
The wine of joy that binds them soul to soul,<br />
Thou art my muse and thine the phantasy<br />
With spirit hand to guide unconsciously.<br />
For all I bring thee, minion of thy beauty,<br />
This little garland of a memory fruity&mdash;<br />
A simple tale, as old as love is old,<br />
Of virgin art within a golden mold,<br />
Still burning, molten, shaping unto glory&mdash;<br />
A matchless song and yet a simple story.<br />
How mischief led a cold unwitting boy<br />
Along new paths to taste a sudden joy;<br />
How curious Love asport from flower to flower,<br />
Hath found a sense too sweet to overpower,<br />
And yet such magic sweet, that once is tasted,<br />
A moment otherwheres were eons wasted;<br />
How Cupid, wandering in a lovely valley<br />
With arrowed bow, by many a maid must dally,<br />
Till Psyche, like a prisms ingathered hues,<br />
Into a sudden virgin light he woos.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet Psyche princes in a golden land,</span><br />
And Princess still from bounding strand to strand,<br />
The fairest maid of any. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cupid heavenly born,<br />
Fair son of Beauty's queen, whom to adorn.<br />
Needs but to name, Great Venus Queen of Beauty&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br />
Whom to adore was but a solemn duty.<br />
This lad whom she hath dowered with all her charms,<br />
A voice resistless and soft amorous arms,<br />
And named him Love, now raptured, lies,<br />
A simple lover in a woman's eyes.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A tale of heart and soul, and so of sorrow,</span><br />
In afterwhiles when riches stoop to borrow&mdash;<br />
A tale of being's subtlest jewelry<br />
O'erlaying grief with golden filigree.<br />
And I would soar on golden wings of song,<br />
And in the souls empyrian float along,<br />
From height to height of all the heart's dear chimes,<br />
To bless thee for the love that thou hast brought,<br />
With greater life. Let tender tinkling rhimes,<br />
Like pure white doves, lead on the lovely thought.</td></tr>

Deep in a woody vale, where crystal streams<br />
Run vaguely like the threads of vanished dreams;<br />
Where fountains tinkle to the yellow sun<br />
Sweet rainbow-tinted hopes, and lightly run,<br />
In joyful race unto the distant ocean;<br />
Where greeny swards are checked with light and shade,<br />
To make a cool retreat for fine emotion;<br />
And velvet lawns, than never weft was laid,<br />
More intricate designed of pleasing hues,<br />
So richly gem'd in Orient pearls of dews<br />
Along quaint aisles in mosques of Samarkand,<br />
To bear some solemn priest in deep devotion;<br />
Where vague far vistas stretch on every hand.<br />
To luring scenes; where happy shepherds amble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><br />
With happy maids, as light as lambs agambol,<br />
Or lie alone, with flocks abrowse by streams,<br />
And rear quaint misty cities out of dreams,<br />
Along far clouds of pearly shape and lining,<br />
In crystal walls and domes of no defining,<br />
And people them with shepherds, maids and gods<br />
That live for love, until the shepherd nods,<br />
And dreams of his own Phillis fairer far,&mdash;<br />
Upon a hillock in a shady grove,<br />
The heart of this fair scene, its central star,<br />
And viewless as the stars of heaven are,<br />
With too much light, stood once the house of love.<br />
A mansion builded of the rarest stone,<br />
Transparent, gem like, carved, and strangely wrought,<br />
As some fine architecture in a dream is sought,<br />
And gird with fancy's fairest flowers blown.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The house of love, and here of balmy days,</span><br />
Its gentle spirits thrid in dreamy maze.<br />
And here the days are always balmy, here<br />
'Tis sweet to laugh, and sweet to drop a tear.<br />
Its crystal halls in magic mirror walls,<br />
Stand empty but for one, while myriad falls<br />
Of lover's feet go tripping after her<br />
Or him and wild faint odors sweetly stir<br />
Through all the room from raptured lovers breathing,<br />
While each a rosy crown for aye is wreathing.<br />
This is the house of love, the golden key<br />
Is faith, sweet faith in joy of living,<br />
That doubts the mirror not, nor cares to see<br />
What hidden scenes the glass is loth in giving.</td></tr>

Here long ago, so runs the gentle tale,<br />
Sweet Psyche, wondrous fair and pearly pale,<br />
Her young loves virgin brow all softly tinting,<br />
With far faint hues of waking loves first hinting,<br />
And all enraptured Cupid, arm in arm,<br />
Secluded far from rude eyes loveless harm,<br />
Have wiled through many a long and gracious hour,<br />
Like fair twin bees within a fragrant flower.<br />
Such love as they have sipt! Such silent bliss<br />
Of raptured bosoms welded with a kiss!<br />
Such kisses lavished rich and juicy ripe!<br />
Such glorious songs as only lovers pipe!<br />
From morn to morn, the lover's boundless season,<br />
Unvext with chilly thought, or chilled with reason.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah! Love thou art a happy reckless boy,</span><br />
To measure ages with a moments joy!<br />
Adown the streams of golden waterfalls,<br />
On hidden rocks the white faced Lurley calls.<br />
Rash wilful Cupid recks without the cost&mdash;<br />
If Venus favor not then all is lost.<br />
Afar he flies unto her royal throne,<br />
To claim the boon of joys that he would own,<br />
And bring unto the mount his glorious bride,<br />
Immortal thence forever by his side.<br />
But Venus, queen of Beauty, waxes wrath,<br />
To find new beauty cross her royal path.<br />
And shall this son of all her royal favor,<br />
Bind to a watery chit of mortal flavor?<br />
Not so! A mother's newest plans are older,<br />
Than any fancy scheme of youthful molder&mdash;<br />
His fate is hers to mold! Then hie away<br />
To sport, but think no more to disobey.<br />
Old mother Locksmith! Venus is thy name!<br />
Of myriad escapades, all back to thee the blame!<br />
The angry queen hath ruled, and Love, achaffing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><br />
At wasted time, hies back to love alaughing.<br />
And he hath sworn that she is fairer far<br />
Than that proud goddess of the morning star,<br />
Albeit queen of Beauty. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here, in mortal line,<br />
Our tale should end beneath the smile parental,<br />
In Iris tinted shower of peace divine,<br />
And blessings less of use than ornamental.</td></tr>

But all the mount hath heard this reckless oath,<br />
And all the mount aghast, if Venus wroth,<br />
Be not the Venus terrible. Alas!<br />
Such lovers make sad flowers in the grass.<br />
And woful trees by many a dusky stream<br />
Embar the fire of many a love's young dream.<br />
And grizzly monsters moan in sunken path,<br />
Some fiery love that stirred the gods to wrath.<br />
But beauty's queen hath brooked no passing jest<br />
To penetrate her deep heart's wild unrest.<br />
But in the stilly quiet of her wrath,<br />
Conceives dark pitfalls for the lover's path.<br />
And she that once hath hied to amorous chase,<br />
And grieved outstript in love's immortal race,<br />
Now calls her white winged swans, on fleecy pinions,<br />
To bear her down to earthly love's dominions,<br />
For naught of love or sorrow. From a cave,<br />
Whence flowed her double fountain bitter wave,<br />
Two serpents, green and gray, and mottled golden,<br />
Within her chariots hold hath she close folden;<br />
Cirque-couchant, glittering, whispering sibilant<br />
Deep curses old, they with their fury pant,<br />
To strains the subtle bonds of jealous art,<br />
And plant deep venomed fangs within her heart.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now the feathry chariot glides along</span><br />
The airy sea, among the sable throng<br />
Of darkling hours, whose soundless feet are gliding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><br />
Unto the amorous dome of Love's abiding.<br />
And they have halted, serpents, swans and queen<br />
Within a grove that shields them with its screen<br />
Of em'rald interlacing. There a little bloom<br />
Of nameless hue, and forest wild perfume,<br />
She plucks, and crusheth in a bowl of jade.<br />
And with her breath a syrup weird hath made,<br />
Whose faint escaping break along dim aisles,<br />
Of forests, brooding mournful eld, beguiles,<br />
Till such a wild heart rending moan hath risen,<br />
As never rose within a tortured prison<br />
To greet a ray of light. But heark'ning not,<br />
She bends above her serpents, breathing hot<br />
Upon their heads, een as they pause to strike,<br />
This mystic lotion. Lo! what wonders like<br />
Hath ever magic seer in lore beholden?&mdash;<br />
Each serpent skin a woman's form enfolden,<br />
That with that breath of drunken magic lotion<br />
Hath sprung to being with an exquisite motion,<br />
And such sweet words, as through a thousand years,<br />
Have gathered music for a tale of tears.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Lo! one groweth old, and very old,&mdash;</span><br />
A toothless haggard hideous to behold.<br />
And one hath grown a marvellous sun-bright creature,<br />
Of luscious form and speechless worship's feature.<br />
One stands like sunlight on a crested wave,<br />
And one like murky darkness in a cave.<br />
But each a low obedient knee hath bended,<br />
To hear the queenly will thus long suspended.<br />
And thus the queen, to her the radiant maiden:<br />
"Thou bitter sweet, thou vessel overladen,<br />
"In yonder dome a fairer maid than thou,<br />
"Sees all her beauty in a lover's vow,<br />
"Nor heeds the ripples on that mirror's sheen,<br />
"From troubled depths of her fair self unseen.<br />
"Go thou, and with thine ointed tongue reverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><br />
"The mirror's face, and there thine own immerse;<br />
"Remembering still, thou hast a serpent's tongue,<br />
"That holds thee slave, till thou hast surely flung<br />
"Its glittering barb into that silly heart."<br />
Then, like an apparition of a dream,<br />
The maid hath vanished, with a hellish gleam.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus the queen, unto that gruesome hag:</span><br />
"In yonder dome a youth hath founden beauty<br />
"Within a maid, and swears all foul and sooty,<br />
"That is not there. Thou hast a serpent's eyes,<br />
"And seeth so what dreary falsehood lies,<br />
"In such a mirror. Go reverse the glass,<br />
"And thine the beauty he has wasted on the lass,<br />
"He hath not seen." The hory dame is gone.<br />
And Venus left within the grove alone,<br />
Recalls her swans and mounts the starry air.<br />
<br />
Then she, the new born maid, as false as fair,<br />
Hath found sweet Psyche in the crystal dome,<br />
And creeping, like a mad thing to her soul,<br />
In friendly guise, exacts a hideous toll<br />
For all her blissful life: "How can she bind<br />
"Her sunny soul to such a treacherous mind?<br />
"And she hath wed a libertine, a rake,<br />
"Whom even now her pleasures must forsake<br />
"To drink new pleasures with another bride.<br />
"And if she creeps in silence to his side<br />
"Forsooth unwelcome sights might come unto her."<br />
With such foul words the fiend began to woo her,<br />
And in her pearly ear hath poured the breath,<br />
Of hideous doubt that stabs her soul to death.<br />
And then hath wandered with exultant heart,<br />
Unto the vales of Crete, her glittering dart,<br />
Of barbed tongue, a woman's sweetness singing,<br />
And ever more hath myriad minions clinging,<br />
Unto her heartless laughter. But no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><br />
To grace our tale. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now the haggard hoar,<br />
On Cupid's angry ears, with whisperings<br />
Of faithless women, and the direful springs<br />
Of wasted lives: "And she hath heard the wind<br />
"Sing always, maids are false and men are blind,<br />
"And in a cavern by the ocean side,<br />
"'Tis daily jest of Wind and Sun and Tide,<br />
"How Psyche tweaks the gentle Cupid's nose<br />
"Between the beds; and Psyche false as fair,<br />
"Needs but a whim to lay her treason bare.<br />
"This very night, if he will but deny her,<br />
"If nothing more, at least 'twere time to try her,<br />
"For sooth unwelcome sights might come unto him."<br />
With such foul words the witch began to woo him,<br />
And in his angry ears hath poured the bane,<br />
That sets his heart at riot in his brain.</td></tr>

What wonder then if in the lonely night,<br />
Sweet Psyche weeps to find her love is slighted;<br />
Feels darkness fall upon her trembling light,<br />
And throws to wind the vows her love has plighted!<br />
And she hath risen from her loveless bed,<br />
With all the stealth her grief supplies instead,<br />
And steals to Cupid's fine unguarded room,<br />
Where she must feast her heart on deeper gloom.<br />
Here Cupid, airy souled, hath fall'n asleep,<br />
Too filled of love such watch for long to keep,<br />
And even now with her in blissful dreams,<br />
He roams again, and all the future seems<br />
As sweets of old. No little pains of doubt,<br />
To mar recalling moments with their rout.<br />
All through the halls, such joy of living blent<br />
Her soul and his in single ravishment.<br />
And Oh! they wander in the flow'ry vale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span><br />
All through the dewy morn and evening pale,<br />
And each to drink the other's loveliness,<br />
Despising richest nectar. Even the stress,<br />
Of queenly anger now had bode its time,<br />
And fresh Aurora speeding to this clime,<br />
Hath Venus' royal word to grant his prayer,<br />
That with the dawn to clasp his Psyche there,<br />
In perfect love, with all the world their own.<br />
Ah, promised day! his eager soul hath flown,<br />
To meet the morning. On his lonely bed<br />
Reclines his happy visionary head,<br />
In such sweet dreams. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An hour hath lightly flown<br />
When o'er his senses steals a softened moan,<br />
As when a soul all pent and warp'd in gloom,<br />
Hath breathed soul deep, some sudden wild perfume,<br />
That is of freedom. Awaked to such surprise,<br />
He sees with heart aghast the famished eyes,<br />
Of Psyche filling to their very brim<br />
With his forbidden beauty, sees for him,<br />
The golden future vanish, sees aghast<br />
For now he knows his lovely dream hath passed;<br />
That soulless doubt hath razed the golden dome<br />
Of his high hopes to desert sandy loam.<br />
The structured palace falls with all its art,<br />
To grieve a valley with an aching heart.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From out a darkened corner of the ruin rises,</span><br />
And laughs to view the dismal crisis,<br />
That baneful hag. But Ah! what beauty fairer!<br />
What luscious form arrayed in raiment rarer!<br />
And she hath flown to vales of Thessaly,<br />
Where ever more her mocking eyes shall see,<br />
A myriad eyes upon her beauty glisten,<br />
A myriad ears unto her rumor listen.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Cupid flees in sudden wild despair.</span><br />
To drown his soul within the bitter fountain,<br />
Nor Venus now may crown his heart laid bare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><br />
Nor any luscious goddess of the mountain.</td></tr>

But Psyche wanders, like a saddened rill,<br />
Thrust from a jewelled grotto in the hill,<br />
To perish in a lonely sandy waste,<br />
And all forlorn, with steps that can not haste,<br />
For such absorbing grief, she chides his heart<br />
That was a glittering palace, now a part<br />
Of ruined things. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She writes within the sand<br />
Some resolution high her grievous heart hath planned&mdash;<br />
A sign to mark the spot, some time, some how,<br />
A charm to lead her back again. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now<br />
A little shrine within a lonely place,<br />
Which flow'ry vines with subtle interlace,<br />
Hath reared to Demeter, her wearied feet<br />
Have found. And all her soul hath flown to meet<br />
Her prayer's happiness. It is a bowl,<br />
Of crystal dew, where nature paints her soul.<br />
And Psyche now, a gentle worshipper,<br />
Hath bent sad prayerful knees, and pearly ear,<br />
Low for the golden oracle. Sad eyes,<br />
In tangled braid of smiles and tears surprise<br />
The crystal truth. Lo! she hath seen. And death<br />
Seems struggling for her weary, panting breath!<br />
What horrid charm of Circe's baneful art!<br />
It is a serpent's head, green eyed and swart,<br />
With lightning flashes of a forked tongue,<br />
And glittering treachery on its forehead hung.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! for a generous draft of that sweet moly,</span><br />
To bring dear Psyche back as pure and holy,<br />
As when a maiden in her jewel palace,<br />
She kissed, for love, her nectar's brimming chalice,<br />
That held serene a limned picture there,<br />
Of wealth of beauty framed in golden hair.<br />
But nature's shrine guides not the errant feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><br />
Of little faith. And sudden prayers all unmeet<br />
For crippled love. Ah! where the happy shrine<br />
Of boundless heart, and still a tongue divine,<br />
In lover's oracles? With holy words<br />
Of sweet ablution when the night engirds<br />
Each little tear? When never a smile but darkens<br />
Its firefly gloom? When never an ear that hearkens.<br />
But dulls a moan? And never a scene outspread<br />
In mirror drops, but darts a serpent's head?<br />
Such bitter moan she made, such bitter moan<br />
No grieving Pan on bursting reeds alone,<br />
In madness ever made to startled streams.<br />
No nightingale her saddest tongueless dreams,<br />
Hath sobbed to beauty on a hidden thorn,<br />
To swoon in over-music at the morn.<br />
But soul is exquisite, the flowers essence,<br />
That through its bruises breathes quintessence.<br />
And all the suffering of the dateless world,<br />
Its rarest, gladdest petals hold enfurled.<br />
This is the soul. Yet all its world a thought<br />
Of smiling strands and sunlit oceans, fraught<br />
With homing argosies. And waneless suns<br />
Shine on its passing gonfalons.<br />
What e'er the mask, its keener eyes see through it.<br />
What e'er the ban its laughter will undo it.<br />
What e'er the time, its fleeting thought will span it.<br />
What e'er the deed its ancient hour began it.<br />
And bruised, unfurl the leaf, the bruise is gone,<br />
Yet heal the wound, the essence breathe right on.<br />
This is the soul. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Psyche grieves an hour<br />
Till every petal in the spirit's flower<br />
Is bruised by so much time, and wand'ring far,<br />
She yet hath wandered farther, like a star<br />
Of aimless race, in melancholy deeps.<br />
Her bittered feet have struggled on the steeps.<br />
Her moaning soul hath crossed the stygian river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><br />
And she hath read the runes of never, never,<br />
In wailing spirits of the sunless moors,<br />
And piteous quagmires seeking piteous shores.<br />
And she, whose mirror was a drop of dew,<br />
When golden fancy played upon her ear,<br />
Now shrieks where horror strikes her spirit through,<br />
Within the gloomy region of a tear.</td></tr>

But one that she hath met within the gloom,<br />
Some shadow wearied from the lake of doom,<br />
Whom she remembers for her ancient self,<br />
Hath led her from the low and crumbling shelf,<br />
That hangs upon oblivion; bound her tresses,<br />
About her brow with old times fond caresses.<br />
And to the weeping shade of beauty's fall,<br />
Presents a little curious lachrimal,<br />
Which she hath wrought with many quaint enlaying<br />
Of happy times and tears. Presents it, saying,<br />
"This is thy beauty bear it to thy love<br />
"And ask no more. Quick to the light above,<br />
"Thy wings must bear this precious charm away,<br />
"Nor pause till thou deliverest it. The day<br />
"Must wane not on thy loveless spirit lorn,<br />
"So long." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then swifter than the dainty morn<br />
She flies unto her love, and all agleam<br />
Her beating fancy lives her future dream.<br />
How fair! How fair! But even as she flies,<br />
The curious urn must tempt her famished eyes,<br />
And she hath paused. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah! woe betide the lover,<br />
That halts to dream, and tempt the soul to steep<br />
In th' unrevealed. What lethe fumes discover<br />
In such unfathomed deeps, of death or sleep!</td></tr>

Had flown to purple lurings of a star,<br />

Now wing'd Apollo, fing'ring golden strings,<br />
Hath wandered far in his dear ponderings,<br />
And fashioned such a music, wild and free,<br />
As wakes to love the cold anemone,<br />
And saddened Hyacinth forgets to moan,<br />
Beside a sweetness sadder than his own&mdash;A<br />
sweeter strain than Orpheus honeyed breath,<br />
Had sung to charm the stygian tides of death.<br />
And Iris on a heavenly message sent,<br />
Hath paused to hear this new forlorn lament.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This tender goddess of all daintiness,</span><br />
Stands tiptoe holding up her showery dress,<br />
'Tween dainty fingers, till the spangled folds<br />
Of mingled hues, in wondrous bow she holds,<br />
And leans to learn what wondrous thing of beauty,<br />
Must prompt so sweet a lay. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forgotten duty,<br />
That bade her speed to regions somnolent,<br />
For balmy dreams, to nurse a languishment,<br />
That pales the boyish cheek of dimpled Cupid,<br />
She speeds where all of beauty's minions groupéd,<br />
Do feast their eyes upon the source of song.<br />
And after her still comes a charmed throng,<br />
From music's toils the slaves of loveliness.<br />
Ah! when this radiant scene her eye doth bless<br />
What sighs are born of deep enraptured joy!<br />

For this is Psyche! This the dainty nymph,<br />

To Somnus' gloomy cavern. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scarce a thought,<br />
Might mark the time in which her pinions brought,<br />
Her to the drowsy rug of poppies spread,<br />
Where drowsy Somnus nods his hoary head.<br />
His myriad minions, like the forest leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><br />
When some wild gust their autumn rest upheaves,<br />
Rush to her overwhelming. Lethe fumes,<br />
Of sweet seduction, oozing from the glooms,<br />
That shield the murky river, drag to aching<br />
Her wearied eyes, and e'en her sense forsaking,<br />
She fain would rest upon the poppied rug,<br />
Like some pale Orient deep within a drug.<br />
But <i>beauty</i> is the dream of godly sleep,<br />
And scare her eyes have fluttered, when a peep<br />
Of golden fragments tantalize their sense<br />
To waking; thus to try, with soul intense,<br />
To reconstruct some evanescent gleam<br />
Of something they remember. Ah! what dream<br />
So fair as Psyche sleeping in a fairy ring?<br />
So fair as languid love's sad wandering<br />
To grief or joy along a feverish beam?<br />
She wakes the drowsy god, demands a dream:<br />
And quits the sunless cave with winged Morpheus.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now again the amorous sire of Orpheus,</span><br />
They meet, and now the sad immortal strain,<br />
Shall lure them on to Psyche's dell again.<br />

All pied and crested like a tiger moth,<br />
When from a soothing beam his heart is loth,<br />
To part, and basks for very idleness;<br />
Those tiny feet where they so lightly press<br />
As not to weight a daisy to the earth;<br />
Turned dimple breasts, such beauty of one birth<br />
As Nature yields no more; one small hand prest<br />
Against them coldly white, and one carest<br />
By raptured blooms, outstretched upon the grasses;<br />
And oh! her head! what glory there surpasses,<br />
Of golden ringlets curling and uncurling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><br />
As gentle Zephyr with a silent purling,<br />
Plays free among them,&mdash;scarcely parted lips,<br />
So flower like, a wild bee drops and sips,<br />
So sweet he flies away full honey laden,<br />
Unconscious of his lightness. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such a maiden<br />
That Morpheus eld historian of th' ideal<br />
Must write another canto. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Softly steal,<br />
The fine emotions o'er his countenance,<br />
As though a prism's unveiléd hues should dance,<br />
Upon a shy chamelion. Seeing this,<br />
The happy Iris mounts upon his bliss,<br />
With soothing words; "Thou seest the butterfly,<br />
"Whose flooding beam hath drown'd dear Cupid's eye.<br />
"The queen demands thou bring him fairest pleasure,<br />
"Of all the joys thou holdest in thy measure.<br />
"Sweet Psyche's story, whispered by the wind,<br />
"In every dewy flower cup thou'lt find,<br />
"As deeply mirrored as the starry skies.<br />
"Fly to the fretting boy with dear surprise<br />
"Of all thy cunning. Kiss his fevered lips,<br />
"As Psyche then, when doubting falls and slips,<br />
"Still left unmarred their blissful stream of life.<br />
"Sweet whisper tales of life and love arife,<br />
"To guide his swooning fancy from its pain,<br />
"To revel in the life of love again."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Dream hath kindled to a gorgeous hue,</span><br />
Out speaking words, and in a drop of dew<br />
Hath read sweet Psyche's tearful story.<br />
And Lo! the boy beholds a growing glory<br />
Of something rich and old; and feels the sense<br />
Of olden kisses planted quick, intense,<br />
And warm caresses softly lingering<br />
To lose no dear sensation. Blushes bring,<br />
In quick succession, while his chin atilt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><br />
'Tween tender fingers, meets a raptured lilt,<br />
Of love for love, as lovers only know.<br />
And he hath seen the bitter path of woe,<br />
Each ragged rock her feet have limp'd upon;<br />
Each hopeless deep, and heard each bitter moan.<br />
And he hath seen her loving spirit burn,<br />
To ope for him the glory of the urn;<br />
Such glory as her joyful eyes have drunken,<br />
Till drugg'd with their own beauty, they have sunken<br />
Unto a dreamless swoon, where ringed thime<br />
Hath framed an art, to rare to draw in rhime.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then hath he risen from his joyless bed,</span><br />
Thrown off his garb of woe, and swiftly sped,<br />
Adown the olden path. And like a thought<br />
His heart hath brought him to this valley fraught<br />
With his rich treasure, all his soul asinging<br />
To name the bubbling hope that he is bringing.<br />
And softly as a warming shadow falls<br />
On flowery paths along the sunny halls,<br />
His gentle words caress her sleeping ear,<br />
With all the magic love that she hath long'd to hear.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A blossom opening to the morning sun,</span><br />
With white cold cheeks the dew hath dreamed upon,<br />
Hath never opened sweeter eyes than hers.<br />
Such sudden pulsing breast! such light that stirs<br />
Such eyes unmeasured deep! as closely folded<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In strong white arms her being is remolded,</span><br />
And Lo! he leads her scarce a thought beyond,<br />
And there where she hath written in the sand,<br />
As though a wizzard waves a magic wand,<br />
The palace rises, new and passing grand.</td></tr></table>
